# Description

## Primary Objective

Develop an algorithm which will output/transcribe harmonicallysound melodic material given a defined chord progression over a defined amount of measures.

## Secondary Objectives

* Software will give an analysis for the end-user to use to study the algorithm's strategies for developing lines
* Software will use idiomatic phrasing in the jazz genre
* Software will be able to use ireal pro images to generate chord progression input
* Software will be able to provide an analysis for pre-existing transcriptions
* Software will be able to impose chords in specified areas of familiar chord progressions
* Software will have different degrees of complexity in outputs, ranging from low volumes of implied harmonies to high volumes
* Software will have different degrees of rhythmic variety (late stage)
* Software will be able to learn transcriptions and translate phrases into vocabulary with sophisticated analysis of harmony, melody, and rhythmic phrasing
* Software will allow changes to be made to input chord progressions
* Software will allow for certain notes to be disabled in contexts
* Software will impose harmonic extensions
* Software will employ good voice-leading techniques
* Software will provide exercises for chord progessions such as: root position arpeggios for each chord; arpeggios with varying directions for each chord that use
* proper voice leading from chord to chord; completely stepwise and uni-directional lines which employ good voice leading and change direction only at specified ranges
* Software will have customizable preset ranges for different instruments such as tenor saxophone and trombone
* Software will be able to transpose inputs or outputs
* Software will be able to generate images of output material to be exported.
* Software will have capability to save/load chord progressions and output material to device of use.
* Software will be able to recognize relationships between chords and target chords and choose from a variety of possible outputs depending on previously used material in the same solo
* Software will be able to assign weight to certain "devices" in line generation- device being defined as a recognizable motif or harmonic approach- so that the end-user can isolate/study that device. A finite set of devices will be pre-defined
* Users will be able to create custom devices
